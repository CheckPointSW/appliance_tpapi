# tex_api
A Python client side utility for using Threat Extraction API calls to an appliance.

It includes Upload API calls, using the User-Check API format ( â€¦/UserCheck/TPAPI).

There's an option of using SSL certificate.

### The flow
Going through the input directory and handling each file in order to get its Threat Extraction results.

For each file:

      1. Uploading the file to the appliance for handling by scrub (tex) feature.

           Using as default:  scrub-method=clean and a predefined list of scrubbed-parts-codes.
    
      2. Writing scrub (tex) upload results into the output directory.
    
           If tex managed to clean the file, then also writing that cleaned file into the output directory.
