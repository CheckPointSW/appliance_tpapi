## te_api
A Python client side utility for using Threat Emulation API calls to an appliance.

It includes Upload, Query and Download API calls, using the Cloud API format ( â€¦/tecloud/api/v#/file/..).

### The flow
Going through the input directory and handling each file in order to get its Threat Emulation results.

For each file:

    1. Uploading the file to the appliance for te and te_eb features.
    
    2. If upload result is upload_success then querying te and te_eb until receiving te results.  (Note, te_eb results of early malicious verdict might be received earlier)
    
    3. Writing to output file the last query/upload response info.
    
    4. If te result is found then display the verdict.  If verdict is malicious then also download the TE report.
