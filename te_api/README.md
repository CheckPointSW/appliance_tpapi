# te_api
A Python client side utility for using Threat Emulation API calls to an appliance.

It includes Upload, Query and Download API calls, using the Cloud API format ( â€¦/tecloud/api/v#/file/..).

### The flow
Going through the input directory and handling each file in order to get its Threat Emulation results.

For each file:

> 1. Querying te cache for already existing results of the file sha1.

>>> If results exist then goto #4, otherwise- continue to #2
    
> 2. Uploading the file to the appliance for te and te_eb features.
    
> 3. If upload result is upload_success then querying te and te_eb until receiving te results.

>>> (Note, te_eb results of early malicious verdict might be received earlier during the queries in between)
    
> 4. Writing to output file the last query/upload response info.
    
> 5. If te result is found then displaying the verdict.  If verdict is malicious then also downloading the TE report.
